      <p> Sheep had been raised almost since man started walking the planet.  They also can produce milk but are mostly raised for their wool or for slaughter.  Easily distinguishable by their wooly coats, sheep grow wool to keep themselves warm in the winter and it is often cut off in the spring and used by humans to produce clothing.   Sheep are also non-effort lawnmowers.  They will eat anything in their path, so if you have a patch of land which needs some clearing such bring your sheep there and let them eat away. Sheep have their disadvantages as well.  A couple of things to bear in mind when raising sheep are that they must be protected from predators for they are small and easy to catch.  Because they eat everything, they can easily obtain diseases and therefore one must check that the vegetation around them doesnâ€™t contain parasites or other harmful things. </p>
