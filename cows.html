    <p>Cows are very often raised on farms.  Cows are very docile and won’t hurt a fly.  They are very big milk producers needing to be milked on a daily basis, sometimes twice a day.  Besides being raised for their milk, many cows are raised in order to be slaughtered for meat.  Besides the benefit of the meat of the cow, the skin can be used as well in order to produce leather.  Leather is used to make shoes, handbags, parchment and other uses.   However, all farm owners agree that the store bought milk is no comparision to the milk wich they obtained from their own cow.  You can make the milk however you desire, full fat or scrape off the fat.  So despite all the work involved in obtaining the milk, at the end of the day you end up with better milk.  Cows aren’t all just fun and games though.  They will have to be milked daily or they will get mastitis which is a painful inflammation of the mammary glands.  They also have to be fenced in or prepare your lasso.  They also cost a lot of money to feed for they need a diet strong in protein which often can’t be obtained through grass alone.  So be prepared to subsidize with bails of hay, beans and other vegetarian high protein foods.</p>
